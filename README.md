## Aim: 
Comprehensive Report on the Fundamentals of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)
Experiment: Develop a comprehensive report for the following exercises:

Explain the foundational concepts of Generative AI.
Focusing on Generative AI architectures. (like transformers).
Generative AI applications.
Generative AI impact of scaling in LLMs.

## Algorithm:
Understand Generative AI Basics
 1. Identify the foundational principles of Generative AI and contrast with traditional AI approaches.
 2. Study architectures such as Autoencoders, GANs, Diffusion Models, and Transformers and
 analyze their generative properties. 
3. Explore applications of Generative AI across multiple industries with real-world examples. 
4. Evaluate the effect of scaling in Large Language Models (LLMs), including benefits, challenges, societal impact, and trends.

## Output
